# DataCollectionGUI
Data Collection GUI app based on wxPython



To use this package open 'helpers.py' and edit the names for the **students_all** variable, following the pattern of surrounding text with single quotes (' ') and separating entries with commas.



This is designed to be used by Teachers for Students with Visual Impairments, and any Tasks, Domains, and Lessons can be edited as you desire. Just do not change any variable names without editing the 'main.py' file accordingly 



At present, all file paths reflect a Windows 11 environment.
